## Loop

This example illustrates how to use a loop in AWPL to repeatedly execute a set of tasks until a given condition is no longer met.

- The application starts with task `t_1`.
- The loop node (`loop_1`) is defined with a `loop_data` section:
  - `loop_identifier_1` is the loop variable. 
  - `init: "t_1"` initializes the loop variable with the output of task `t_1`.
  - `loop: "t_2"` updates the loop variable during each iteration with the result of task `t_3`.
- The condition checks whether the value of `loop_identifier_1` equals `10`. If the condition is satisfied, the body of the loop executes again.
- The body of the loop consists of two tasks: `t_2` and `t_3`
- Once the loop condition evaluates to false, execution continues with task `t_4`, which depends on the loop node `loop_1`.
