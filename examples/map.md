## Map

This example shows how to use a map node in AWPL to apply a set of tasks in parallel to each element of a list.

- The application begins with task `t_1`, which produces a list output (e.g., `[1,2,3,4]`).
- The map node (`map_1`) takes this list as input via the `items: "t_1"` field. Each element in the list is processed independently in parallel.
- The body of the map defines the tasks executed for each list element:
  - `t_2` runs first for each item.
  - `t_3` depends on `t_2`, so it runs afterward, still within the context of each list element.
- Once all elements have been processed by the map node, execution continues with `t_4`, which depends on `map_1`.
